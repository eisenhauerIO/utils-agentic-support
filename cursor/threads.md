The following two threads are from Boris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code.

He gives a detailed explanation of how he uses Claude Code, and tips from his team. 

I want you to read these threads come up with a plan for how these suggestions can be applied to my use of Cursor, Claude Code, etc. 

Figure out what needs to be done to implement these suggestions. Do you need to create an AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md file? Do you need to create subagents? Do you need to create a new slills as SKILL.md?

Find the Cursor documentation and the Claude Code documentationfor details and examples about how to implement these recommendations.
