- **Naming**: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes

### General
- Indentation: 4 spaces
- Max line length: 120 characters
- Error handling: Try-except with logging
- Prefer pandas for data manipulation

## Common Workflows

### Git Workflow
- Follow GitHub Flow (feature branches from main)
- Use Conventional Commits format:
  - `feat:` new feature
  - `fix:` bug fix
  - `docs:` documentation
  - `refactor:` code refactoring
  - `test:` adding tests
  - `chore:` maintenance

### Testing
- Run tests: `pytest`
- Run with coverage: `pytest --cov`
- Always run tests before committing

### Code Quality
- Format: `ruff format .`
- Lint: `ruff check .`
- Fix: `ruff check --fix .`

## Domain Context

### Causal Inference
- Distinguish between correlation and causation
- Document identifying assumptions explicitly
- Prefer potential outcomes framework notation
- Reference relevant econometric methodology

### Data Handling
- Use artifact-store for file I/O when available
- Support both local and S3 storage patterns
- Prefer Parquet for data files, YAML for configs

## Known Pitfalls

<!-- Add corrections here as you encounter issues -->
<!-- Example: "When creating pytest fixtures, always use scope='function' unless shared state is explicitly needed" -->

---

## Verification

Before completing any task:
1. Run the test suite if tests exist
2. Run linter to check for issues
3. Verify changes work as expected
